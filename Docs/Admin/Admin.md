# `Admin`

`Admin` is one of the core components, receives many of the properties provided by a user and sends them to the correspondent sub-components. Some of those properties are not required. When those properties are not provided, the `Admin` component will use a set of default ones.
It's main responsibility is to create an authentication route and store modules, decide whether a user is authenticated or not and finally render the proper component, given an authentication scenario.
Communication to the store match the structure provided in the `authModule` (e.g.: `@va-auth/store`) and `@va-auth/types`.

## props

### authProvider

+   **Type:** `Function`

+   **Details:** A function used to call different mutations in an authorization module. It is in fact the an adapter for a client (e.g.: axios) you'd like to use to perform requests to a server.

### authLayout

+   **Type:** `Object (optional)`

+   **Details:** A component that is used by the router whenever the store `AUTH_IS_AUTHENTICATED` getter returns `false`. When using your own authLayout, a va `Object` will be provided with a `login` function that receives two arguments: `{String} username`, `{String} password` and updates the stores state.

+   **Default:** `AuthLayout`

### homeLayout

+   **Type:** `Object (optional)`

+   **Details:** A component that is used by the router whenever `/` is visited.

+   **Default:** `HomeLayout`

### options

+   **Type:** `Object`

+   **Details:** Allows users to provide their own store modules. Instead of providing an authProvider, an authModule can be passed to the instance.
You can use the following options:  
    +   `authModule`: a vuex store object.

>   An `authModule` must be created with authProvider internally, it is internally used as the authentication client. The `@va-auth/store` module contains a valid implementation.

+   **Example:**

```js
import AuthTypes from 'vue-admin-js'
const adminOptions = {
  authModule: {
    namespaced: true,
    actions: {
      ...
    },
    getters: {
      [AuthTypes.AUTH_GET_STATUS]: state => state.status,
      [AuthTypes.AUTH_IS_AUTHENTICATED]: state.isAuthenticated,
      [AuthTypes.AUTH_GET_USER]: state.user
    }
    mutations: {
      ...
    },
    state: {
      error: '',
      isAuthenticated: false,
      status: 'idle',
      user: {},
    }
  }
}
```

### sidebar

+   **Type:** `Object (optional)`

+   **Details:** A sidebar component that used by the `appLayout` prop. If you want to use your own sidebar, you might want to take a look at the [**Sidebar docs**](../Ui-Components/Sidebar.md).

+   **Default:** `DefaultSidebar`

### title

+   **Type:** `String (optional)`

+   **Details:** a string used by the `appLayout` as the toolbar title

+   **Default:** `Vue Admin`

### unauthorized

+   **Type:** `Object (optional)`

+   **Details:** A component that is used by the router whenever a user is not authorized to visit certain views.

+   **Default:** `UnauthorizedLayout`

## internal props

### appLayout

+   **Type:** `Object (default)`

+   **Details:** when a user is authenticated, `appLayout` is passed as prop to the `Authenticated` component.  

+   **Source:** `AppLayout`
